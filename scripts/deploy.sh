# Deploy, with a preflight, and make the deployment say which commit it is.
#
# TWO JOBS, AND THE FIRST ONE IS NEW.
#
# 1. REFUSE TO UPLOAD INTO A WORKER THAT CANNOT RUN. wrangler.jsonc lists every
#    secret this Worker needs under `secrets.required`. That field warns in
#    local dev and generates types; it does NOT stop a deploy. So this script
#    asks Cloudflare which secrets the target Worker actually has and refuses to
#    upload when any are missing.
#
#    The failure it prevents is specific and was live until 2026-09-02:
#    wrangler.jsonc named `bread-feedback-form` while this script deployed to
#    `miden-feedback-v2`. `wrangler secret put` takes the name from the config
#    file, so secrets went to a Worker that does not exist (the API answers
#    10007) while the application ran somewhere else. Secrets are per-Worker and
#    write-only, so nothing announced it — the first request needing one would
#    just fail. Deploying into an empty Worker is the same failure with a
#    different first symptom.
#
# 2. MAKE THE DEPLOYMENT TRACEABLE. Cloudflare recorded `Source: Unknown` for
#    every deployment this Worker ever had, which made "is master what is
#    running?" answerable only by comparing dates. Three records now, because
#    they fail differently:
#
#      --tag       the short SHA, shown in `wrangler deployments list`
#      --message   the SHA plus subject, for a human reading the dashboard
#      --var       COMMIT_SHA, which /health reports — the only one checkable
#                  from outside against the thing actually serving traffic
#
# THE WORKER NAME IS NOT SET HERE. It comes from wrangler.jsonc and nowhere
# else, so `wrangler deploy`, `wrangler secret put`, `wrangler secret list` and
# `wrangler tail` all agree by construction. Do not reintroduce --name.
#
# A DIRTY TREE IS REFUSED. A deployment tagged with a commit that does not
# describe the deployed code is worse than an untagged one. ALLOW_DIRTY=1
# overrides, for when that is genuinely the intent.
#
# Usage:  npm run deploy
#         SKIP_SECRET_CHECK=1 npm run deploy   (first deploy of a NEW Worker)
#         ALLOW_DIRTY=1 npm run deploy         (deliberately untraceable)
