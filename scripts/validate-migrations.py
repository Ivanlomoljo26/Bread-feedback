"""Replay EVERY migration, in order, and prove the result is schema.sql.

This is the check that matches how production is actually built.

`check-schema-drift.py` compares one PR's migrations against schema.sql, which
catches the mistake being made right now. It cannot catch an older one: a
migration that was wrong when it landed, or a schema.sql that was hand-edited
to paper over a migration that never said the same thing. Those two databases
have already diverged, and nothing notices until a query touches the column
that exists on only one side.

So this replays the whole chain:

    schema.sql AS IT WAS before the first migration existed
      + 0001, 0002, ... 000N applied in order        (the production path)
      ==
    schema.sql AS IT IS NOW                          (the fresh db:init path)

EVERY TABLE IS COMPARED, not a named list. A table nobody remembered to add to
the list gets no protection at all, and gets it silently — which is the same
class of failure this file exists to prevent, one level up. Tables are
discovered from the databases themselves, so a new one is covered the moment it
is created.

WHY THERE IS A "BASE" AT ALL.
Migrations 0001-0006 are ALTER TABLE against a `submissions` table that already
exists, so they cannot be replayed onto an empty database. The base is the
committed schema.sql from the parent of the commit that introduced the first
migration — the last state of the world before migrations began. It is found
from git history rather than pinned, so it survives the file being renamed.

Needs full git history: run with fetch-depth 0 in CI.

Usage:  npm run check:migrations
        python3 scripts/validate-migrations.py [--base-ref <ref>]
