/**
 * The vocabulary of Store Reviews: three state machines, one label set, and
 * the rule that decides what may enter the existing feedback pipeline.
 *
 * DATA, NOT CODE. Every value a store review can hold is listed here as a
 * literal, in one place, so the console, the classifier, the reply publisher
 * and the handoff cannot disagree about what a state means. This follows
 * publish-guard.ts, where the allowed transitions are a table rather than a
 * chain of ifs — a rule you can read in one screen is a rule that can be
 * reviewed.
 *
 * WHY THREE MACHINES AND NOT ONE ENUM.
 * The brief lists 22 statuses, and they mix three unrelated questions: where a
 * review is in triage, what has been done about replying to it, and whether it
 * has entered the pipeline. As one enum they could not express "actionable and
 * reply published", which is an ordinary state for a real review — and the
 * first time that came up someone would add a compound value, and then another.
