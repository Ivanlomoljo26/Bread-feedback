/**
 * Raw store payload -> NormalizedReview. The contract every source produces.
 *
 * PURE. No database, no network, no clock beyond what is passed in. Everything
 * here is a function of its input, which is what makes the whole ingestion path
 * testable before a single credential exists.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE IS THE POINT OF THE WHOLE DESIGN.
 * There will be at least three producers of store reviews:
 *
 *   1. the Google Play API          (last 7 days only)
 *   2. the Play Console CSV export  (everything older — the only way back)
 *   3. the App Store Connect API
 *
 * Each speaks a different shape. If each also carried its own idea of what a
 * duplicate is, they would disagree, and the disagreement would show up as the
 * same review stored twice. So they converge HERE, on one record, and exactly
 * one place downstream decides identity: `upsertReview` in upsert.ts.
 *
 * Two producers, one dedup path. That is the rule.
 *
 * THE ORIGINAL IS AUTHORITATIVE, THIS IS NOT.
 * Every field below is derived for querying and rendering. `raw` is stored
 * verbatim beside them, and the derived columns are recomputed from it. That
 * is deliberate and load-bearing: it is what makes it safe to write this
 * normalisation against Google's DOCUMENTED schema before anyone has seen a
 * real payload. If a field turns out to sit somewhere else, it is a re-parse
 * of stored data, not a re-fetch of data we no longer have access to.
 *
 * Fields marked ASSUMPTION below are the ones to check against the first real
 * response. None of them can lose data if wrong.

   * invent one: a synthesised id would be unique every run, so re-importing
   * would silently create a second row for every review — the exact failure
   * the constraint exists to prevent, arriving through the back door.
