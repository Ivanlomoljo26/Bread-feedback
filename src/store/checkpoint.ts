/**
 * Sync checkpoints, retries and backoff — `store_sync_state`.
 *
 * One row per (source, app_id), holding where the last run got to and how it
 * went. It exists so a sync that is interrupted resumes instead of restarting,
 * and so a sync that is FAILING is visible as a countdown rather than as
 * silence.
 *
 * THE COUNTDOWN IS THE POINT, NOT THE HEALTH CHECK.
 * Google Play serves only reviews created or modified in the last 7 days. A
 * review that ages out of that window is unreachable through the API forever —
 * recoverable only from a Play Console CSV export, if anyone thinks to take
 * one. So the question worth alerting on is not "did the last sync fail" but
 * "how long has it been since one SUCCEEDED", measured against 168 hours.
 *
 * That is why `last_success_at` is a typed, indexed column rather than a value
 * inside a JSON blob: the alarm is a query against it.
 *
 * BACKOFF IS CAPPED FAR BELOW THE WINDOW, DELIBERATELY.
 * Unbounded exponential backoff is the right default almost everywhere and the
 * wrong one here. Doubling from minutes reaches days within a dozen failures,
 * and a day of backoff against a 7-day window is a day of reviews at risk. The
 * cap keeps a broken sync retrying often enough that fixing the cause within a
 * few days still recovers everything.
