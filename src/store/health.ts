/**
 * Per-store sync status, for /health.
 *
 * A sync that has stopped collecting is INVISIBLE from outside until somebody
 * opens the console and notices the queue has not grown. That is the wrong way
 * round for the one failure with a deadline attached: Google serves only the
 * last 7 days, so a Google Play sync that stops is losing reviews on a clock,
 * and the loss is unrecoverable through the API. The App Store has no such
 * cliff, which is why only one of these two sources reports a countdown.
 *
 * WHAT THE ALARM SHOULD WATCH IS `windowConsumed`, NOT `state`. checkpoint.ts
 * makes the argument in full: the question worth waking someone for is not
 * "did the last run fail" — runs fail transiently all day — but "how long has
 * it been since one SUCCEEDED", measured against the window. `state` says what
 * the scheduler is doing and why; the number says how much has been burned.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE: `last_error` and `paused_reason`. Both are
 * built from upstream responses, and /health is untokened — the same reasoning
 * that moved the per-state census behind a token. An uptime monitor needs to
 * know that a sync is paused and for how long; the sentence explaining which
 * upstream code came back belongs where a person has signed in. No review text
 * and no configured app id leaves here either: the source is named, the app is
 * not.

   * unreachable — recoverable only from a Play Console CSV export.
   *
   * WHAT IT DOES NOT MEASURE: whether anything was actually lost. Below 1 is
   * not proof that every review was collected — a sync can be fetching pages
   * happily and still be behind, or have missed a review that moved mid-pass.
   * Above 1 is not proof that something WAS lost either: it says the window
   * has turned over since the last good fetch, not that reviews arrived in it.
   * It is a countdown on exposure, not an audit of what was collected.
   *
   * App Store Connect serves a review's whole history and has no such cliff,
   * so reporting a fraction for it would assert a deadline that does not
   * exist. Null there always, and null for Google until a first success.
