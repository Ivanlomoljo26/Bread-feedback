/**
 * One sync run, end to end — and the only part of the ingestion path that
 * knows about all the others.
 *
 * It takes a fetcher, walks its pages, normalises each raw review, writes it
 * through the single dedup path, and records where it got to. It contains no
 * credential, no HTTP, and no knowledge of Google or Apple: Phase 1 supplies
 * `fetchPage`, and this is already built and tested by then.
 *
 * A FAILED RUN IS STILL A PARTIALLY SUCCESSFUL RUN.
 * If page four throws, pages one to three are still written. That is not
 * sloppiness — it is the only correct behaviour against a source that serves a
 * 7-day window. Discarding three good pages because a fourth failed risks
 * reviews that may never be offered again, and it is safe to keep them because
 * `upsertReview` is idempotent: the retry re-reads nothing it does not need to.
 *
 * ONE BAD REVIEW DOES NOT FAIL THE BATCH.
 * A payload that will not normalise is counted, logged and skipped. The
 * alternative — throwing — lets a single malformed record block every good
 * review behind it, on a clock, which is the worst possible trade here.
