/**
 * The half of the SameSite fix that a unit test cannot prove.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `SameSite=Strict` on the OAuth state cookie shipped, passed
 * every unit test, and would have failed on the first real sign-in: Google
 * returns the browser by a TOP-LEVEL CROSS-SITE NAVIGATION, and a Strict cookie
 * is withheld on exactly that. The suite missed it because it sets the `Cookie`
 * header by hand — fabricating the thing under test. Only a real browser with a
 * real cookie jar, crossing a real site boundary, can tell the two apart.
 *
 * SELF-CONTAINED, so a clean clone and a CI runner behave like a laptop: it
 * starts and stops its own `wrangler dev`, WAITS for readiness rather than
 * sleeping, uses a THROWAWAY database directory, applies every migration into
 * it, and seeds its own administrator. It never touches .wrangler/state or any
 * database a person is using, and it reads no .dev.vars.
 *
 * THREE CHECKS, IN THIS ORDER, AND THE ORDER IS THE POINT.
 *
 *   1. POSITIVE CONTROL — same-site, Strict session, the console opens.
 *      Without it, step 2 is ambiguous: a sign-in page after the cross-site hop
 *      could equally mean "the cookie was withheld" (what we want to prove) or
 *      "the cookie arrived and the user is not on the allowlist" (a broken
 *      fixture). Proving the session WORKS first removes the second reading.
 *
 *   2. NEGATIVE CONTROL — cross-site, that same Strict session is withheld.
 *      If it survives, these two origins are not cross-site to this browser and
 *      step 3 would pass with the bug still present. That is INCONCLUSIVE, and
 *      the script says so and exits non-zero rather than claiming a pass it did
 *      not earn.
 *
 *   3. THE ACTUAL TEST — cross-site, the Lax state cookie survives.
 *
 *   Worker      http://localhost:<port>    (site A)
 *   Bounce page http://127.0.0.1:<port>    (site B — different host, so a
 *                                           different site for cookies)
 *
 * Usage:  npm run test:oauth
